ev calculations for my game, farmer warrior thief

Rules:
Each player chooses to be a farmer, warrior, or thief at the start of the game (you can write it down on a piece of paper, or use playing cards). Then, you have a discussion and try to figure out the other player's role and try to conceal yours. At the end, you guess the other player's role (again with playing cards or written down so each player guesses independently). Farmer gets 1 point if it guesses the other player's role correctly, and one point if it isn't guessed. Warrior gets 2 points if it guesses the opponent's role correctly. Thief gets 2 points if it isn't guessed. Play to 10 points
